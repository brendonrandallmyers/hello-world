Hi all, I’m a musician (composer/guitarist) in NYC who’s suddenly got a lot of gig-less time on my hands. I have some coding experience - I did some basic web development work (HTML/CSS and some light hacking/modding of php/js) for a music nonprofit a while back. There’s only so many skype lessons a boy can teach (and so many times I can beat Dark Souls 3), so - partly to maintain my sanity and partly to develop some potentially employable skills - I’m trying to get back into coding. Looking to refresh my existing knowledge and expand my skillset towards being a fullstack developer, with the goal of eventually being able to take on freelance work.
